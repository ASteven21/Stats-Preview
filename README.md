## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use the order property and the mix-blend-mode property. The mix-blend property is very interesting to me because I just knew that you could blend the image with the background color of your choosing.

### Continued development

I want to improve more on how to adjust the size of the image.

### Useful resources

- [@VernonDodo](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/statspreviewcardcomponent-obPXYEVbB) - I learned about mix-blend-mode from looking at this gentleman's code.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css3_pr_order.asp) - I found out about the order property from this website.
